So basic cli functionality seems to be good to go.  I haven't tried it with an
ardunio yet, but it does compile - and as a bonus it works!

Right now there are only two functions implemneted, both of which are tests.

type 'make' to make the program.  A binary file name 'out' willbe created.
Invoke it and it will ask for a command, enter 'test' and it will run the test
function.  Then try 'arg_test' with any number or arguments and it will show
off its ability to parse args.


I don't believe I'm using any stdlib things in the actuall code that matters
(other than maybe stdio?).


FILE STRUCTURE:
    Function definitions should go in the function.c file and be defined in 
    the header.

    CLI modifications and improvments should go in the cli.c file

    Anything that doesn't really fit into a defined category should go into the
    util file and header.  This header file also defines some of the typedef'd
    types that we use.  I tried to use unsigned chars (that I typedefed) in most
    places because of memory constraints.
